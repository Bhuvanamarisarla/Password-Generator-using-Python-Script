This Python script creates a simple password generator using the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a brief description of the code:

Tkinter GUI Setup:

The script uses Tkinter to create a window with a set size (400x400 pixels) and a title ("PASSWORD GENERATOR").
The window contains labels, buttons, and a spinbox for selecting the password length, along with an entry field to display the generated password.
Password Generation Logic:

The Generator() function is responsible for creating a password based on the length specified by the user.
It ensures that the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one punctuation symbol, as long as the length is 4 or greater.
For lengths below 4, it simply fills the password with random characters.
The password is then shuffled to ensure randomness.
Clipboard Functionality:

The Copy_password() function allows the user to copy the generated password to their clipboard using the pyperclip module.
User Interaction:

Users can generate a password by clicking the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button, and they can copy the generated password by clicking "COPY TO CLIPBOARD."
This script provides a straightforward and user-friendly way to create strong random passwords with customizable lengths, all through a simple GUI.
